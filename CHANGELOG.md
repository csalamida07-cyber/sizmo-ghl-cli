# Changelog

All notable changes to `sizmo` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.2] — 2026-07-02

### Changed
- Repo moved to `github.com/csalamida/sizmo-ghl-cli` (owner renamed from `csalamida07-cyber`).
  Updated the `repository`/`bugs`/`homepage` URLs, README badges + clone commands, and CHANGELOG
  links. Old links still redirect; this makes the npm metadata point at the canonical URL. No code
  change.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-06-28

### Changed
- README: added a **"What it does"** capability map (See / Act / Build / Delete / Bill / Operate) so
  the full 2.x shape reads at a glance, refreshed the positioning, and fixed a stale update-notifier
  example + the contract reference. Docs-only patch — published so npm's package page reflects it
  (npm READMEs only update on publish). No code change.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-27

**Breaking (security posture, not the API contract).** The "**money never moves**" guarantee is
removed. sizmo now follows **scope-is-the-gate**: it exposes whatever your PIT's scopes + GoHighLevel's
*public* API allow — including money-side writes (draft/send an invoice). It still **cannot charge a
card** (GHL exposes no public endpoint for that). The CLI contract — exit codes, the `--json`
envelope, command/flag names — is **unchanged and backward-compatible**; the major bump signals that
`SECURITY.md` no longer promises money can't move. Grant money scopes deliberately.

### Added
- **`sizmo invoice draft --contact <id> --item "Name:amount[:qty]"`** — create a **draft** invoice
  (a document — not sent, no charge). Pulls the contact + business name to assemble the body.
  **Verified live.** Scope: `invoices.write`.
- **`sizmo invoice send <invoiceId>`** — send an invoice; delivers a **pay-link / text-to-pay** the
  customer acts on (not a card charge). Scope: `invoices.write`.

### Changed
- **Money policy → scope-is-the-gate** (the breaking note above). `init`'s scope copy-block and
  `auth check` now include `invoices.write`. SECURITY.md + README rewritten accordingly.
- `sizmo crm <fields|tags|calendars|pipelines|users>` shows each item's **id inline** in the human
  listing (was only in `--json`) — completes the loop: `crm fields` → copy id → `field delete <id>`.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Single-target delete** — `sizmo contact delete <id>`, `sizmo field delete <id>`,
  `sizmo value delete <id>`. Deliberately designed against the "I deleted one custom field and it
  wiped them all" accident: takes **exactly one id** (no `--all`, no wildcard, no batch); **fetches
  the resource and shows its name** in the confirm preview first; a wrong/nonexistent id →
  `NOTFOUND` with nothing touched; then deletes that **one** resource by its id path. Confirm-gated
  like every write. Verified live (deleted a real field/value/contact by id, confirm-gate intact).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-27

Builder/scaffold minor — sizmo grows from "see + nudge" into "see + nudge + scaffold." Additive;
the frozen 1.x contract is unchanged. Ships everything since 1.1.0 (includes the 1.2.0 convenience
round below).

### Added
- **Build/scaffold writes** — stand up a GHL location from the terminal instead of clicking:
  `sizmo contact create`, `sizmo field create` (custom field), `sizmo value create` (custom value).
  All confirm-gated like the other writes. Design principle: **the PIT scope is the gate** — if the
  token carries the write scope the command works, otherwise it fails with `AUTH` + the exact scope
  to add. `init`'s scope copy-block + `auth check` now include `locations/customFields.write` and
  `locations/customValues.write`.
  > Verified live against a real GoHighLevel location — contact/field/value create all returned ids,
  > and the confirm-gate previews then fires correctly.

### Fixed
- The profiles-config path is now resolved lazily (at call time, not import time), so a machine that
  has a saved default profile no longer fails `npm test` / `npm publish` — the three "no creds"
  tests now isolate to a temp config dir instead of depending on a pristine `~/.config/sizmo`.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-26

Convenience minor — make sizmo nicer to use day-to-day. Additive only; the frozen 1.x contract is
unchanged. No new capability (still reads the same CRM, money never moves) — purely usability.

### Added
- **`sizmo open <id>`** — open a contact (or `--opp` for their opportunities) in the GoHighLevel web
  app from the terminal; `--url` just prints the link. No API call, no write — a convenience bridge
  from "found it in the terminal" to "act on it in GHL". White-label host via `SIZMO_APP_URL`.
- **`sizmo completions zsh|bash`** — tab-completion for commands + flags, generated from the live
  schema so it never goes stale. Install: `eval "$(sizmo completions zsh)"` in your shell rc.
- **`sizmo help <command>`** (and `sizmo <command> --help`) — per-command help with real, runnable
  examples, not just a flag list. `<command> --help` no longer errors as an unknown flag.
- **Per-row next-step commands** on the people-recipes (`receivables`, `triage`, `noshow`,
  `booked-not-paid`) — each row prints the ready-to-run `sizmo send …` / `sizmo open …` line with the
  real contact id, so you act without retyping. (Writes still require `--confirm`; money never moves.)

### Fixed
- Ranker hardening (found by an adversarial sweep of the money core): a non-finite money value
  (e.g. `Infinity` from bad upstream data) no longer ranks #1 or turns the headline total into `—`
  — it's treated as value-unknown, consistent with how `money.mjs` renders non-finite amounts. The
  sort tie-break now guards a `NaN`/undefined age so an equal-money tie can never drop an item via a
  non-deterministic comparator. Both are edge-only — no change to normal output.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-26

First feature minor since 1.0. Additive only — the frozen 1.x contract (exit codes, the `--json`
envelope, command/flag names) is unchanged. Includes everything from 1.0.1 below.

### Added
- **`--ndjson`** — streamed machine output: a leading meta line (carrying `command`, `location`,
  `degraded`, `warnings`, `count`, and every non-list field) then one JSON object per list item.
  Lets an agent process large lists line-by-line without buffering, and — unlike a bare CSV — the
  meta line means a blocked/`degraded` source is never silently dropped. No-list payloads (e.g.
  `doctor`) emit a single envelope line. Honors `--fields`. Shape frozen for `1.x` (see
  `API-STABILITY.md`).
- **`SIZMO_PROFILE` env var** — select a saved profile without `--profile` on every call
  (precedence: `--profile` flag > `SIZMO_PROFILE` > saved default). Mirrors `AWS_PROFILE`.

### Fixed
- **`--fields` now actually projects `brief` and `pipeline`.** Their list keys (`actions`, `stuck`)
  were missing from the projection set, so `--fields` silently did nothing on them. Now covered,
  plus a guard test that fails if any list-bearing recipe's key drifts out of the set (so the
  silent no-op can't return).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **`auth check` no longer reports "all green" while offline.** The shared scope probe treated a
  transport error (could-not-reach, `code:0`) the same as a real `200` — so on a dropped/flaky
  connection `auth check` printed "6/6 lanes readable · usable" and exited 0, while `doctor` (which
  patched around the same probe) correctly said "OFFLINE". The probe now treats `code:0` as
  unverifiable (not granted) at the source, and `auth check` reports "could not reach GoHighLevel"
  + exits non-zero when every lane is unreachable. Both commands now agree. (Pass-3 fake-green.)
- **Dates/times now render in the location's own timezone, not a hardcoded `Asia/Manila`.**
  `brief`, `snapshot`, `noshow`, and `booked-not-paid` showed every date in Manila time regardless
  of where the GoHighLevel location actually is — so a US/UK/AU client could see the wrong day in
  the `brief` header and Manila-shifted appointment times. The timezone now comes from the synced
  CRM model's location (it was already stored); when no model/timezone is available it still falls
  back to `Asia/Manila`, so existing PH users are unchanged. (Human output only — no contract change.)
- CHANGELOG: the 1.0.0 entry said CI runs on "Node 20 + 22" in one line and "22 + 24" in another;
  the real matrix is 22 + 24.

### Documentation
- Documented the already-shipped token-lean flags `--fields` (project list items to named keys, on
  every list-bearing recipe) and `--concise` (leaner `brief` payload) in the README + API-STABILITY,
  and froze them under `1.x`. No code change — these shipped earlier but were undocumented; they're
  the lowest-token way for an agent to consume sizmo.

### Security
- Completed the URL-encoding hardening started in 0.9.0: `encodeURIComponent` is now applied to
  every user-supplied id interpolated into a request path — `appointment cancel <apptId>`,
  `note <contactId>`, `opp move/update <oppId>`, and the `triage` conversation fetch. 0.9.0 had only
  covered location ids; a malformed/hand-edited id can no longer alter a request's path or query.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-17

First stable release. 1.0 is a **trust + stability commitment**, not new features — the public
contract is now frozen under semver (see `API-STABILITY.md`). Everything below is the trust
scaffolding that makes the existing CLI dependable.

### Added
- `SECURITY.md` — security policy, threat model, and verifiable guarantees (zero-deps,
  PIT-never-in-argv, money-never-moves, no-telemetry), each with a self-audit recipe.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file; release history backfilled from 0.4.0.
- `scripts/prepublish-gate.mjs` — wired into `prepublishOnly`; **aborts `npm publish`** unless the
  git tree is clean and HEAD is tagged `vX.Y.Z` matching `package.json`. Closes the loophole that
  let 0.7.0–0.9.0 ship while git was stuck at 0.6.0. No bypass flag.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — documented the release ritual; corrected the stale "never writes" claim
  (confirm-gated operational writes exist since 0.6.0; money still never moves).
- CI — GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): runs `node --test` on Node 22 + 24 on every
  push/PR, plus a generic gitleaks secret scan. CI / npm / zero-deps badges in the README.
- `API-STABILITY.md` — the frozen public contract for 1.x: exit codes, the two JSON contracts
  (data-command envelope + per-verb router shapes), `schemaVersion` policy, flag/command stability,
  and an explicit list of what is NOT covered (human output, stderr, internal modules).
- `docs/maintainers/api-versions.md` — where the GHL API date-version pins live, the deprecation
  watch, the bump procedure, and the Node-floor policy.

### Changed
- **Node floor raised to `>=22`** (current Active LTS; Node 20 reached end-of-life). `engines` is
  advisory — a user on an older Node gets an npm warning, not a failure. CI matrix is now 22 + 24.
- README now opens with a **"Why sizmo"** section (vs the GHL web UI / the official MCP server /
  Zapier-style automation) — the reason-to-choose, not just a feature list.

### Fixed
- **brief no longer fakes "all clear" on a wrong/expired PIT.** When a data source is blocked, the
  headline reads `No leaks in readable data · ⚠ partial` (not a falsely-complete "No leaks found")
  and the footnotes point to `sizmo doctor`. Found via a 1.0 unhappy-path review.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- Zero-dependency **update notifier**: a once-a-day npm-registry check that prints a one-line
  "newer version available" nudge to stderr. Cached 24h, fail-silent/offline-safe, never under
  `--json` or when piped. Opt out with `--no-update-check`, `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER`, or
  `SIZMO_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`. No telemetry — a plain GET that sends nothing about you.
- `sizmo doctor` now reports a **CLI VERSION** line (cache-read-only; never gates health).
- `lib/money.mjs` — single source of truth for currency symbols + money formatting.

### Changed
- Currency formatting unified across all 7 commands that render money (previously duplicated).

### Fixed
- Currency symbol drift: an AUD/CAD amount rendered `A$`/`C$` in the brief headline but `AUD `/`CAD `
  in the ranked line — both now resolve from one symbol table.
- Removed dead never-billed code in `brief` (was never collected and could never rank).

### Security
- `encodeURIComponent` applied to every location-id URL interpolation in `lib/model.mjs`
  (defense-in-depth against a malformed/hand-edited location id corrupting a request).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- **Currency honesty:** the `brief` headline summed an amount but labelled it with the *model's*
  currency symbol — a ₱ figure could display as `$`. The headline symbol now follows the amount's
  own currency.
- **Exit-code consistency:** `sizmo doctor` now treats a blocked `contacts` scope as a usability
  floor and exits `AUTH`, matching `sizmo auth check`.

### Security
- Profile file (`profiles.json`, holds the PIT) is now written **atomically at mode 0600** —
  temp file created owner-only then renamed, removing a brief window where it was world-readable
  and preventing a half-written file on crash.
- `encodeURIComponent` on location id in the scope-probe and doctor connectivity check.

### Changed
- Tightened several tests that were too weak to catch a regression (fake-green guard).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- `sizmo init` — guided activation: prints the GHL path + exact scope copy-block, takes the token
  from stdin only, writes the profile, and auto-runs `doctor`. Agent-drivable non-interactively.
- `sizmo doctor` — one-shot health diagnosis (scopes, location reachability, CRM-model freshness),
  with an exact fix line per blocked scope. Never reports green when a lane is blocked.
- Share-worthy `brief`: an honest headline (`<currency>X found · N need you today`) plus
  `--format slack|md`. The `--json` envelope is unchanged — human render only.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Operational writes** — `tag`, `note`, `opp`, `appointment`, `send`. Every write requires
  `--confirm`; without it the CLI prints the exact change + a rerun command and exits 5. Money
  endpoints (charge/collect/refund/invoice-issue) are deliberately excluded.
- Per-profile **memory**: "what changed vs last run" deltas, plus `ack`/`snooze` to hide handled
  items. All local — no GHL writes.
- Token-lean flags: global `--concise` and `--fields` projection.

### Changed
- `brief --json` payload trimmed ~87% (use `--verbose` to restore the raw sources blob).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-13

### Added
- Local **CRM model** — `sizmo sync` caches slow-changing structure (pipelines/stages, calendars,
  tags, custom fields, users, location) under `~/.config/sizmo/`.
- `sizmo crm` query surface (counts, lists, per-entity staleness).
- An id→name resolver that never fabricates: a cache miss renders `<unknown:id — run sizmo sync>`.

### Changed
- Recipes read structure from the local model instead of re-fetching it every run; currency comes
  from the location, not a hardcoded value.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- Post-launch patch fixes following the initial public release.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-13

### Added
- Initial public release. Read-only GoHighLevel recipes: `brief`, `snapshot`, `triage`, `pipeline`,
  `noshow`, `receivables`, `reconcile`, `booked-not-paid`, `focus`, `segment`.
- Private Integration Token (PIT) auth via stdin/env (never argv); multi-profile config.
- Stable `--json` envelope (`schemaVersion: 1`); `sizmo auth status` / `auth check` / `schema`.
