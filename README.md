**Unofficial GoHighLevel CLI — read your CRM + make confirm-gated operational changes from the terminal. Money never moves through it.** Not affiliated with HighLevel.

> Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by HighLevel. This is an independent open-source tool.

`sizmo` reads your GoHighLevel location — leads, bookings, pipeline, A/R, money leaks — from the terminal. Write operations (tag, note, opp, appointment, send) require explicit `--confirm`; without it the CLI prints the exact change and a rerun command, then exits 5. Nothing fires silently. Money stays out — no charges, collections, refunds, or invoice-issuing; payments and invoices are read-only.

## Install

Requires Node.js 20+.

**Option A — npm (recommended):**

```sh
npx sizmo brief            # run with no install
# or install globally:
npm install -g sizmo
sizmo brief
```

**Option B — clone + install (puts `sizmo` on your PATH from source):**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/csalamida07-cyber/sizmo-ghl-cli
cd sizmo-ghl-cli
bash install.sh
```

`install.sh` symlinks `bin/sizmo.mjs` into `~/.local/bin/sizmo`. Add `~/.local/bin` to `$PATH` if not already present (the script will warn you if needed).

**Option C — clone + run directly:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/csalamida07-cyber/sizmo-ghl-cli && cd sizmo-ghl-cli
node bin/sizmo.mjs brief
```

Then set up a profile. **Easiest — guided:**

```sh
sizmo init
```

`sizmo init` walks you through it: it prints the exact GoHighLevel path + the scope copy-block, takes your token from stdin (never argv), writes the profile, and runs `sizmo doctor` to confirm you're green — all in one run. Agent-drivable too: pipe the token in non-interactively.

```sh
echo "pit-yourtoken..." | sizmo init --profile myclient --loc YOUR_LOCATION_ID
```

**Manual alternative:**

```sh
echo "pit-yourtoken..." | sizmo config set --profile myclient --loc YOUR_LOCATION_ID --pit-stdin
```

PIT = Private Integration Token. Find it under GoHighLevel Settings > Integrations > Private Integrations. Never pass it as a command-line argument — always pipe it via stdin.

When creating the Private Integration, grant these scopes for the full `brief`:

```
contacts.readonly · conversations.readonly · opportunities.readonly
calendars.readonly · invoices.readonly · payments/transactions.readonly
```

For write commands (tag, note, opp, appointment, send), also add:

```
contacts.write · opportunities.write · calendars.write · conversations/message.write
```

Granting fewer is fine — missing scopes show as ⚠ in affected metrics rather than failing the whole command. Run `sizmo auth check` after setup to see a per-lane scope report.

**Auth: PIT vs MCP** — `sizmo` uses a Private Integration Token (PIT), not the GoHighLevel MCP server. See [`docs/how-to/auth-pit-vs-mcp.md`](docs/how-to/auth-pit-vs-mcp.md) for the comparison and when you'd want each.

Verify auth — or just run the one-shot health check:

```sh
sizmo doctor            # scopes + location + CRM model + version, one screen
sizmo auth status
sizmo auth check
```

`sizmo doctor` is the "is it me or the tool?" answer: it reports each scope (✓/⚠/✖ with the exact fix line for any blocked one), location reachability + latency, CRM-model freshness, and whether a newer `sizmo` is available — and it never reports green when a lane is blocked.

## Commands

Command list generated from `sizmo schema` (authoritative — pulled directly from the code):

| Command | Summary | Key flags |

| `sizmo snapshot` | Monday card — 6 metrics, one screen | `--days N` (default 7) |
| `sizmo triage` | Who is waiting on a reply, longest first | `--top N` (default 10), `--days N` (default 30) |
| `sizmo pipeline` | Pipeline health — value by stage + stuck deal sweep | `--stuck-days N` (default 7), `--top N` (default 100) |
| `sizmo noshow` | No-show recovery — who to re-book | `--days N` (default 30), `--top N` (default 15) |

| `sizmo booked-not-paid` | Sessions with no invoice or payment — the money leak | `--days N` (default 30), `--top N` (default 15) |
| `sizmo focus` | One ranked to-do queue by money at stake | `--top N` (default 15), `--stuck-days N` (default 7) |
| `sizmo segment` | Find contacts by criteria — tag, phone, age, etc. | `--tag X`, `--without-tag X`, `--no-tags`, `--created-days N`, `--has-phone`, `--no-phone`, `--top N` (default 20) |
| `sizmo crm` | Query the local CRM model — counts, lists, staleness | `--all` (show all items) |
| `sizmo sync` | Refresh the local CRM model (pipelines, calendars, tags, fields, users, location) | `[entity]` (sync one) |

### Writes (confirm-gated)

These commands change data in GoHighLevel. Every write requires `--confirm`; without it the CLI prints the exact change + a rerun command and exits 5. Nothing fires silently. Money never moves — no charge, collect, refund, or invoice-issue.

| Command | Summary | Required flags | Scope needed |
|---------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| `sizmo tag <contactId> --add <tag>` | Add a tag to a contact | `--add` or `--remove` | `contacts.write` |
| `sizmo tag <contactId> --remove <tag>` | Remove a tag from a contact | `--add` or `--remove` | `contacts.write` |
| `sizmo note <contactId> --text "..."` | Add a note to a contact | `--text` | `contacts.write` |
| `sizmo opp create --name --pipeline --stage --contact` | Create a pipeline opportunity | `--name`, `--pipeline`, `--stage`, `--contact` | `opportunities.write` |
| `sizmo opp move <oppId> --stage <name>` | Move an opportunity to a stage | `--stage` | `opportunities.write` |
| `sizmo opp update <oppId> [--value --status]` | Update value or status of an opportunity | `--value` or `--status` | `opportunities.write` |
| `sizmo appointment book --calendar --contact --start` | Book an appointment | `--calendar`, `--contact`, `--start` | `calendars.write` |
| `sizmo appointment cancel <apptId>` | Cancel an appointment | apptId positional | `calendars.write` |
| `sizmo send <contactId> --channel sms\|email --message "..."` | Send an SMS or email | `--channel`, `--message` | `conversations/message.write` |

**How writes work:**

```sh
# Step 1 — preview (no --confirm): prints change description + rerun command, exits 5
sizmo tag cid-001 --add VIP --json

# Step 2 — execute (with --confirm): fires the write, exits 0
sizmo tag cid-001 --add VIP --confirm

# --dry-run: shows change description without executing, exits 0
sizmo tag cid-001 --add VIP --dry-run
```

Pipeline/calendar names are resolved to IDs from the local CRM model. Run `sizmo sync` first if you've changed stages or calendars.

### Utility commands

```sh
sizmo init              # guided setup: scopes → token (stdin) → profile → doctor
sizmo doctor            # one-shot health: scopes, location, model, version
sizmo schema            # machine-readable command tree (JSON)
sizmo auth status       # show credential source, location, masked PIT, rotation age
sizmo auth check        # probe live API to verify PIT scopes
sizmo config list       # list all saved profiles
sizmo config use <name> # switch default profile
sizmo config set --profile <name> --loc <id> --pit-stdin
sizmo config rm <name>  # remove a profile
sizmo api /path         # raw GET escape hatch (--paginate --max-pages N)
```

### Global flags (work with every command)

```
--profile <name>     use a named credential profile
--json               machine-readable output (stable JSON envelope)
--fresh              bypass 60-second read cache — re-fetches live data
--no-cache           alias for --fresh
--no-update-check    skip the once-a-day "newer version available" check for this run
```

## JSON envelope

Every command supports `--json`. The envelope shape is stable:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "command": "brief",
  "location": "LOC_ID",
  "data": { ... },
  "degraded": false,
  "warnings": [],
  "cacheAgeMs": 0
}
```

`degraded: true` means at least one data source was blocked (scope or auth). Read `warnings`. A blocked source is not zero — treat it as unknown.

**Router verbs differ.** `init`, `auth`, and `config` are setup verbs, not data commands — their `--json` output is a purpose-specific object (e.g. `auth check` → `{ lanes, usable }`, `init` → `{ profile, location, ok, doctor }`), not the `data`/`degraded`/`warnings` envelope above. The data commands (brief, snapshot, doctor, …) all use the envelope.

Both contracts are frozen under semver — see [`API-STABILITY.md`](API-STABILITY.md) for exactly what you can depend on across `1.x` (exit codes, JSON shapes, `schemaVersion` policy, flag names) and what you can't (human output, stderr text, internal modules).

## Staying up to date

`npx sizmo` always runs the latest published version. If you installed globally (`npm i -g sizmo`), the CLI checks npm **at most once a day** and prints a one-line nudge to stderr when a newer version exists:

```
⚠ sizmo 0.9.0 available (you have 0.8.0) — update: npm i -g sizmo@latest
```

`sizmo doctor` also shows a CLI VERSION line. The check is privacy-clean: a single GET of the public npm registry, cached 24h, never blocking, nothing sent about you. Turn it off with `--no-update-check` (per run) or the `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` / `SIZMO_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` env vars. It never runs under `--json` or when output is piped.

## Your CRM model

`sizmo` caches the slow-changing structure of your CRM — pipelines + stages, calendars, tags, custom fields, users, and location — in a local file (`~/.config/sizmo/model/<locationId>.json`). Recipes read from this cache instead of re-fetching structure on every run.

**What it stores:** pipeline/stage names + IDs, calendar list, tag list, custom fields, user roster, and location info (timezone, currency, country). Structure only — no contacts, no conversations, no payments.

**Sync once, read fast.** The model is synced automatically on first use. After that, recipes use the cached copy. Run `sizmo sync` after you change your pipeline stages or add calendars:

```sh
sizmo sync                # full refresh (all 6 entities)
sizmo sync tags           # refresh one entity only
```

**Age is always shown.** `sizmo crm` shows how old each entity is. Stale entries (past TTL: 24h for pipelines/calendars/users/location; 12h for tags/fields) show a warning. The CLI never silently serves stale structure as current.

**Model never auto-syncs when stale.** It serves the cached data with a loud age banner. This avoids surprise network calls mid-recipe. Use `sizmo sync` or `--fresh` to force a refresh.

```sh
sizmo crm                 # overview: counts + age per entity
sizmo crm pipelines       # list pipelines + stages
sizmo crm calendars       # list calendars
sizmo crm tags [--all]    # list tags (truncated at 20 by default)
sizmo crm fields          # list custom fields
sizmo crm users           # list users
sizmo crm location        # timezone / currency / country
sizmo crm pipelines --json  # machine output with _meta.source/syncedAt/ageMs/stale
```

The JSON `_meta` block in every `crm` response lets agents branch on staleness without parsing prose:

```json
"_meta": { "source": "cache", "syncedAt": 1718000000000, "ageMs": 3600000, "stale": false, "offline": false }
```

**Scope requirements** for a full sync: `opportunities.readonly`, `calendars.readonly`, `locations/tags.readonly`, `locations/customFields.readonly`, `users.readonly`, `locations.readonly`. A 401/403 on one entity marks it blocked; the rest still store. `sizmo crm` shows `✖ needs <scope>` for blocked entities.

## Safety model

- **Reads are always free.** Read commands never change anything in GoHighLevel.
- **Writes require explicit `--confirm`.** Tag, note, opp, appointment, and send commands print the exact change + a rerun command and exit 5 (confirmation-required) without `--confirm`. Nothing fires silently — safe for agent use.
- **Money stays out.** No charge, collect, refund, or invoice-issue — ever. Payments and invoices are read-only in every path. The only writes are operational: tags, notes, opportunities, appointments, and messages.
- **`--dry-run` available on all writes.** Shows the change description without executing. Exits 0.
- **PIT never in argv.** Credentials are passed via stdin (`--pit-stdin`) or env var (`--pit-env VAR`). Never logged, never echoed raw.
- **60-second read cache.** Repeated calls within 60s return cached data. `cacheAgeMs` in the envelope tells you how old. Use `--fresh` to bypass.

Every claim above is verifiable — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the threat model, the self-audit recipes, and how to report a vulnerability. Zero runtime dependencies: what you read is what runs.

## Honest limitations

- **Rate-limit cap: 5 concurrent requests.** The pool is capped at 5 to avoid hammering the GHL API.
- **Cache TTL: 60 seconds.** Stale data possible within that window. Use `--fresh` when you need live.
- **No-show / booked-not-paid calendar truncation.** GHL's `/calendars/events` endpoint has no pagination cursor. If a calendar returns >= 100 events the result may be silently truncated. A `degraded: true` warning is emitted in that case.
- **Pipeline currency.** GHL opportunity monetary values carry no currency field — they inherit pipeline config. The CLI renders them as-is; cross-currency totals are never summed.
- **No workflow writes.** This tool has no workflow-authoring capability. Workflow creation stays in GoHighLevel's UI.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | OK |
| 1 | API error |
| 2 | Usage error (bad flag / unknown command) |
| 3 | Auth error / no location resolved |
| 4 | Not found (unknown pipeline/stage/calendar name) |
| 5 | Confirmation required — rerun with `--confirm` to execute |

## Multi-client

```sh
sizmo config set --profile clientA --loc LOC_A --pit-stdin
sizmo config set --profile clientB --loc LOC_B --pit-stdin
sizmo brief --profile clientA
sizmo brief --profile clientB
```
